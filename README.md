# Syntactic-Parser

## Description
This app allows the user to input a file containing a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). It will then use that grammar to syntactically parse any sentences that user inputs, using the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm.

## Instructions

1. Install [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open your Python interpreter to the directory of this project.
3. `python Parse.py`
4. Follow on-screen directions. A context-free grammar for parsing can be found in the data folder.
